The primary purpose of this extension is to make copying text from similar webpages easier.

After installing, a page reload may be necessary for the extension to work.

When active, this extension allows a user to select content on a webpage. The location of the content will be remembered by the extension, and when a configurable hotkey is entered or a button is clicked, it will fill the user's clipboard with it in a formatted manner; either tab-delimited(for spreadsheet pasting), or a custom format as defined by the user that may contain rich text(an interface for bold, or italics is supported).

The default profile matcher can be disabled, in which case a profile must be created on the extension's options page. Multiple profiles can match the same URL, and then be selected individually based on user preference.

Profiles may have formatters attached to individual keys. The button that may be clicked to copy the text can be positioned in a desired corner and given an optional distance(200 max) from that corner in pixels; it can also be removed entirely.

A notification will be displayed is the same area as where the button is set to appear when data is copied.

This extension only stores its data locally, and nothing is sent to any remote or external service.
