### Default Profile Enabled

The default profile will, if enabled, match by default any URL: `*://*/*`, of course, that can be changed in the [profile screen](/profiles). Any choice made here is automatically saved.

### Blank Content Replacement

This is the value that blank content(e.g., content that would result in empty text), will be replaced with. Any text entered here is automatically saved.

### Hotkey

Hotkey can also be configured from this screen as well. To configure, hit **Record**, enter the hotkey on the keyboard as it would be used, then hit **Stop Recording**. Any recordings made here are automatically saved.
